Greeeings Pythonistas,

---     ADDED NOTE    ---
 
NOTE: I updated heapmodule.py and added tests/testE_heaps.txt  on 20-MAR-2015 at 12:35 pm.

DO THIS: Replace your own heapmodule.py and add tests/testE_heaps.txt.

THANKS: Thanks to Jennifer for catching an issue that she discovered when 
        running   $ python3 heapmodule.py

This is LAB09 : datastructlab .

It's about data structures and how to create user-defined classes like Stack, Queueu and Heap.

So, good practice with OOP in Python, and some important data structures.
