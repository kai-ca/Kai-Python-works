These tests are not new, they are from the documentation strings in heapmodule.py.

Try this
$ python3 heapmodule,py


>>> from heapmodule import Heap

Create an empty heap.

>>> myheap = Heap()

>>> isinstance(myheap, Heap)
True



>>> for x in [50, 60, 20, 50, 30]:
...     myheap.push(x)

>>> myheap.pop()
60

>>> myheap.is_empty()
False

What's at the top of the heap now?

>>> myheap.peek()
50
