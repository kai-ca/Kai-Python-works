We test our Heap class.

Heaps can be implemented to be very efficient but we are just practicing OOP programming in this lab.


>>> from heapmodule import Heap


>>> mylist = [30, 50, 20, 60, 50, 40, 20]

>>> isinstance(mylist, list)
True


Create a heap from the given mylist.

>>> myheap = Heap(mylist)

>>> isinstance(myheap, Heap)
True

>>> myheap.peek()
60

>>> myheap.pop()
60

>>> myheap.peek()
50


>>> myheap.pop()
50
>>> myheap.pop()
50
>>> myheap.pop()
40
