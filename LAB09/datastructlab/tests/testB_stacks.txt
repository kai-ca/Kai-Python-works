We continue to test stack methods.

>>> from stackmodule import Stack

>>> mystack = Stack()

>>> isinstance(mystack, Stack)
True


The Stack has a push method.  Push a bunch of numbers  onto the stack.

>>> for item in [90, 30, 50, 60, 20, 50]:
...     mystack.push(item)

Your  __str__ method is used by print to get a nice format here.

>>> print(mystack)
<Stack: 6 items>

>>> mystack.peek()
50

>>> print(mystack)
<Stack: 6 items>

Remove an item from the stack using the pop method you defined for Stack.
Notice that it's LIFO !


>>> mystack.pop()
50

>>> print(mystack)
<Stack: 5 items>



>>> while not mystack.is_empty():
...     print(mystack.pop())
20
60
50
30
90

>>> mystack.is_empty()
True
