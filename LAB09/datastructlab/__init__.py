This is datastructlab where define some important types of data structures 
by defining three different classes, namely

    Stack       ---  Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure, like a stack of plates

    Queue       ---  First In First Out (FIFO) data structure, like a line at the movie ticket office

    Heap        ---  The biggest item is always at the top of the heap.


GAMEPLAN:

    Read the tests in tests/testA_stacks.txt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testA_stacks.txt is OK.

    then continue with 

    Read the tests in tests/testB_stacks.txt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testB_stacks.txt is OK.

    Read the tests in tests/testC_queues.txt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testC_queues.txt is OK.

    Read the tests in tests/testD_heaps.txt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testD_heaps is OK.

    Read the tests in tests/testE_heaps.txt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testE_heaps is OK.
