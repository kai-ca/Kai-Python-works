>>> from frequency import freqdict, print_freqtable

>>> myrolls = [5, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6]

>>> freqdict(myrolls) == {2: 1, 4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 5}
True


>>> print_freqtable(myrolls)
      item   freq
         2      1
         4      3
         5      1
         6      5

We want to show items that have frequency zero too, so provide keys.

>>> print_freqtable(myrolls, keys=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
      item   freq
         1      0
         2      1
         3      0
         4      3
         5      1
         6      5

Here is a ton of results from rolling a pair of dice.

>>> mypairs = [(4, 6), (3, 3), (3, 2), (5, 6), (6, 2), (1, 6), (6, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 4), (1, 1), 
... (3, 3), (1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (3, 2), (5, 5), (6, 1), (4, 6), (6, 2), (4, 
... 5), (4, 5), (5, 6), (2, 3), (1, 6), (3, 6), (6, 3), (3, 3), (1, 6), (5, 5), (2, 3), (5, 2), 
... (6, 4), (4, 3), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (4, 3), (2, 6), (2, 
... 6), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (3, 5), (1, 6), (5, 3), (5, 3), (6, 1), (5, 1), (1, 4), (4, 2), 
... (6, 5), (3, 6), (2, 3), (6, 6), (4, 5), (3, 4), (6, 5), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 6), (5, 1), (3, 2), (4, 
... 3), (3, 4), (5, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6), (2, 6), (6, 6), (3, 6), (2, 3), (1, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), 
... (4, 2), (2, 4), (6, 2), (6, 5), (5, 5), (3, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (6, 3), (5, 1), (3, 
... 5), (6, 2)]

We want to make a table of the sums of those rolls.

>>> from dice import dice_sum

Make a list of the sums of those dice.

>>> mydicesums = [dice_sum(pair) for pair in mypairs]

>>> mydicesums 
[10, 6, 5, 11, 8, 7, 10, 2, 5, 8, 2, 6, 4, 7, 6, 9, 10, 11, 5, 10, 7, 10, 8, 9, 
9, 11, 5, 7, 9, 9, 6, 7, 10, 5, 7, 10, 7, 7, 5, 4, 6, 6, 9, 8, 9, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 
8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 7, 6, 5, 6, 11, 9, 5, 12, 9, 7, 11, 4, 6, 9, 6, 5, 7, 7, 10, 8, 10, 8, 
12, 9, 5, 6, 9, 4, 9, 6, 6, 8, 11, 10, 8, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 6, 8, 8]

Here is a table of those sums. We didn't roll a sum of 3.

>>> print_freqtable(mydicesums)
      item   freq
         2      2
         4      4
         5     10
         6     15
         7     16
         8     18
         9     16
        10     10
        11      6
        12      2


Provide keys and we can see that sum 3 has frequency 0.

>>> print_freqtable(mydicesums, keys=range(2, 13), label='sum')
       sum   freq
         2      2
         3      0
         4      4
         5     10
         6     15
         7     16
         8     18
         9     16
        10     10
        11      6
        12      2
