GAMEPLAN:

    Read the tests in tests/testA.txt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testA.txt is OK.

    Read the tests in tests/testBtxt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testB.txt is OK.

    Read the tests in tests/testC.txt
    Write code in cycle.py until tests/testC.txt is OK.

>>> from cycle import Cycle
>>> from data import SEASONS

>>> SEASONS
['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter']

>>> seasons = Cycle(SEASONS)

>>> isinstance(seasons, Cycle)
True

This attribute knows how many items are in the Cycle object.

>>> seasons.n
4

This is a pointer at the cyclic "wheel" of items.
It points to the "current" item.

>>> seasons.item()
'Spring'

>>> seasons.pointer
0

>>> seasons.rotate()

>>> seasons.pointer
1
>>> seasons.item()
'Summer'




>>> from data import WEEKDAYS

>>> WEEKDAYS
['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']

>>> week = Cycle(WEEKDAYS)

>>> week.n
7

>>> isinstance(week, Cycle)
True


>>> for count in range(10):
...     print(week.item())
...     week.rotate()
Mon
Tue
Wed
Thu
Fri
Sat
Sun
Mon
Tue
Wed

>>> week.pointer
10

Reset the pointer to 0.

>>> week.pointer = 0
>>> week.item()
'Mon'
>>> week.rotate()
>>> week.item()
'Tue'
