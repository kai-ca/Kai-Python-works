>>> from data import DIRECTIONS, WEEKDAYS

Create cyclic data structures using the Cycle class.

>>> compass = Cycle(DIRECTIONS)

>>> isinstance(compass, Cycle)
True

>>> week = Cycle(WEEKDAYS)


--- The Seven Days of the Week ---

Imagine a pointer pointing at the cyclic wheel of week.
It starts at position 0.

>>> week.item()
'Mon'

>>> week.pointer
0

>>> week.rotate()

The pointer has moved forward by one step so now it is 1.

>>> week.pointer
1

>>> week.item()
'Tue'


Rotate by 21 steps, 3 whole weeks forward.

>>> week.rotate(21)
>>> week.item()
'Tue'


--- The Four Cardinal Directions ---

>>> DIRECTIONS
['North', 'East', 'South', 'West']

>>> compass = Cycle(DIRECTIONS)

The "first" direction is North.

>>> compass.item()
'North'

>>> compass.pointer
0


But, in some cultures the "first" direction is East, not North.

We can reset the pointer so that we "start" at 1.

>>> compass.pointer = 1

>>> compass.item()
'East'

>>> compass.rotate()

>>> compass.item()
'South'

>>> compass.rotate(21)

>>> compass.item()
'West'
